\chapter{Future Work}

The concept of composing functional operations, at runtime or compile time, has implications beyond JavaScript and array operators. Being able to support streams and generators would be of minor effort, but would allow for even more data types to qualify for the optimization.  Working with a language that is statically typed would remove a lot of the guess work from the process in general, and would allow for more consistent and rigorous optimizations.  Taking the optimization out of the JavaScript code and moving it into the engine would open up many more avenues for optimizations and would also minimize the duplicated effort in parsing and compiling the JavaScript code at runtime.

Beyond all of this, there are more general optimizations that could be made, by the nature of recompiling the code at runtime, and specifically merging multiple bodies of code together into a single function.  The v8 JavaScript engine is already great at optimizing where it can, but even just reducing the amount of code it has to evaluate (constant folding, algebraic simplifications, dead code elimination, etc. would be useful enhancements).
