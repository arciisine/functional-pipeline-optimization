\section{Analysis Framework}

The \javascript analysis framework works in the following phases.  
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Identify} The first phase identifies and transforms potential optimization sites at a source code level.  This process happens by parsing   the \javascript and analyzing the resultant abstract syntax tree.  We look for patterns that identify potential \pipelines.  Since \javascript is dynamic we cannot guarantee that the functional pipeline is actually running on a list.
  \item \textbf{Prepare} Once we identify a potential \pipeline
