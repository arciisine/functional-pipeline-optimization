\section{Contributions}
This thesis makes the following contributions
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{\Algorithm} - An algorithm for analyzing \javascript to transform \pipelines into standard \inlinecode{for} loops.
  \item \textbf{\Algorithm Implementation and Framework} - An implementation\cite{fpo16} of the \algorithm has been produced in TypeScript and is available for download and usage. It also has a framework for creating new implementations of the algorithm for \pipelineoperators other than \javascript arrays.
  \item \textbf{Performance Analysis Framework} - The \algorithm implementation\cite{fpo16} also provides a performance \algorithm that was used to produce the data used in this paper.  In addition to data generation, it also provides functional to generate visual output via gnuplot.
