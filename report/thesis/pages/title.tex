\begin{abstract} 
There has always been a disconnect between how humans organize computer code, and how compilers optimize it.  Many times the act of creating abstractions adds computational weight to software in order to increase maintainability, testability and decrease overall complexity.  Generally the additional abstractions do not impact performance signficantly due to the frequency with which the abstractions are invoked.  However, code that is executed many times over, would benefit from optimization as the cost of the introduced abstractions are amplified.
