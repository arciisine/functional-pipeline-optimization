\subsection{Invocation Form}
The next step is to process the candidate optimization into the final invocation form.  This massages the the call chain into a final form that allows for maximal performance at runtime.  The entire goal of the invocation form is to minimize any overhead at runtime.  The reason for this, is that the overhead for execution of the optimized form, assuming chain target is an array, will have significant performance impact smaller arrays.  For the transformation to be generally useful it needs to perform well on arrays of size $0$ as well as arrays of size $100000$.

\end{minipage}

Given the goal of minimizing the final form's computation, the chain is reorganized into predetermined arrays that can be handed piecemeal to different functions without the need for any memory allocations, string concatenations or function invocations.

When invoking an optimized code path, the only data that is needed is the $target$, $context$, $closed$ and $closure assignment$.  These variables are utilized by the optimized code path, in the expressed form. 

The final form also needs to accomodate when the $target$ is not an array, and needs to be invoked in a manner equivalent to the original form.  \\

All that occurs is each chain operation is invoked as a member of chain target (with the appropriate input), and that is stored as the new chain target.  This is functionally equivalent, and generally as performant as the original form. %Needs proof/verification

Hopefully this highlights odd partitioning the problem, and shows the intricacy of the interplay between source code analysis and the runtime optimization.
