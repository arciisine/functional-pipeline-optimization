\section{Assumptions}

This dynamic nature of JavaScript lends itself to powerful flexibility but also makes static analysis, without making strong assumptions, very difficult \cite{staticanalysis12}.  In the case of this optimization, the goal is to mimic a programmer's behavior.  If the generated code contains the same errors a programmer would have made in manual conversion, we assume the process to be correct.  The code may be broken, but it's broken in a way that is consistent with the programmer's mental model.  The goal is not to achieve perfection, but to automate the currently manual process.
