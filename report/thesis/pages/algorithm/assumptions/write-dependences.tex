\subsection{Write Dependences}

The optimization's entire structure is centered around altering the order of execution, specifically to avoid any intermediate storage of results.  Given that the order of operation has changed, any writes or modifications of closed variables has now introduced a functional change.  Again, this is an identical problem a programmer would face if they were to manually convert the candidate optimization into a procedural form by hand.  Additionally, since property accesses can actually result in writing values, and methods can be rewritten at runtime, determing writes is fairly complicated. 

Ultimately this leads us to the point that we will ignore the concept of write dependences as they cannot be proven except at runtime (if even then).  We will behave in a manner that is consistent with a hand generated optimization.  If we were to only allow optmizations only on literal function parameters (numbers, strings, booleans) with the rule that no properties can be accessed, we would have a much higher degree of certainty that we will not have any write dependences. This would, unfotunately, make the optimization far less useful.
