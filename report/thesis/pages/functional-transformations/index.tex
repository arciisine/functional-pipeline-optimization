\section{Functional Transformations}

The paper will reference a simple algorithm, to highlight the specific problem, and the necessary steps needed.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Recieve text as a string
  \item Split text into a list of words
  \item Remove all words that are 3 characters or less
  \item Convert all remaining items to lower case
  \item Maintain counter for each word 
  \item When counter passes threshold, emit value
\end{enumerate}

Given the above listing, what you can see is that there is a set of filters, transformations, aggreagations that need to be applied in order to produce the desired output.  This results in a sequence of operations that the data will be manipulated through and ultimately producing the correct results.  

This sequence creates the flow of operations that every text block, and word will have to go through.  This form has a few benefits, specifically that each step is clear and easy to verify.  Additionally, because of the modularity of the functions, each step is easy to modify.  This modification will produce a new program with a high certainty of correctness given the isolation from every other step in the sequence.  

Functional isolation and purity ultimately lend themselves to code that is easier to write, easier to maintain, and easier to verify.
